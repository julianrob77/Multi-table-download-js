# Multi-table-download-js
extends HTML to css plugin, you can find documentation about that here:
https://github.com/FuriosoJack/TableHTMLExport

Note that you do not need to add classes to table elements- the script will add table class for bootstrap.
minor changes to the plugin, updated the PDF CDN URL, and added th element for JSON export (in the case where th is the first column)

Exports each table in numerical order, starting at "table1"
